This is an example of how to use HAML and Sass (3.3+) with Sinatra, while incorporating Bourbon, Neat, Bitters, and a modified example from Bourbon Refills. 

To get started, run:

    git clone git://github.com/mdavidgreen/sinatra-bourbon.git SITENAME
    cd SITENAME
    bundle install

To start running locally, run:

    rackup

Or to allow full reloading during development:

    shotgun
